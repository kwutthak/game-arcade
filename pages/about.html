                    <h2> About Me </h2>
                    <p> Hello Everyone ! My name is Gun Wutthakul and I am the creator of this arcade website.
                        I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of California, Davis.
                        This website was made as a required project for one of my course but I intend to expand
                        it further beyond the assignment's requirements (if time allows). I hope everyone enjoys
                        what I've created. Feel free to contact me if you have any question through this email:
                        kgun.wutthakul@gmail.com
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="about">
                    <h2> About This Website </h2>
                    <p> This little website intends to be a collection of a few simple arcade game selections where
                        you can play straight from your browser! The first version of this website includes 3 games
                        in total with more potentially being added some time in the future. As you can already tell,
                        the theme of this website is heavily inspired by sanrio creations with soft aesthetics and
                        cute cartoon characters. My intended audience for this website is children to teenagers as
                        the games tend to be more on a simpler side but nevertheless everyone is welcome.
                        The game collection currently includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Whack-A-Mole </li>
                            <li> Memory Cards </li>
                            <li> Dino Runner </li>
                        </ul>
